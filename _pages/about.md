I am a second-year **M.S. student** in the **Department of Industrial and Systems Engineering** at **KAIST**, advised by **Prof. Hwanjun Song**. I received my **B.S. in Industrial Engineering** from **Yonsei University**, where I worked as a research intern with **Prof. Kyungwoo Song**. I hold **dual citizenship** of the **United States of America** and the **Republic of Korea**, and I am planning to apply for Ph.D. programs in Fall 2026 as a domestic student in the U.S.

My research focuses on enhancing **multimodal large language models (LLMs)** and **vision–language models (VLMs)** for deeper understanding across multiple modalities, including images, text, audio, and video. I am particularly interested in advancing **AI–human interaction**, aiming to develop systems where AI can accurately interpret human intentions and humans can effectively guide AI’s development. I approach this goal from a **multimodal perspective**, seeking to bridge modalities for more natural and effective interaction.
