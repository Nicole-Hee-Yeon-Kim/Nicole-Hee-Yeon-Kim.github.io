I am a second-year M.S. student in the Department of Industrial and Systems Engineering at KAIST, advised by Prof. Hwanjun Song. I received my B.S. in Industrial Engineering from Yonsei University, where I worked as a research intern with Prof. Kyungwoo Song. I hold dual citizenship of the United States of America and the Republic of Korea, and I am planning to apply for Ph.D. programs in Fall 2026 as a domestic student in the U.S.

My research focuses on enhancing multimodal large language models (LLMs) and vision–language models (VLMs) for deeper understanding across multiple modalities, including images, text, audio, and video. I am particularly interested in advancing AI–human interaction, aiming to develop systems where AI can accurately interpret human intentions and humans can effectively guide AI’s development. I approach this goal from a multimodal perspective, seeking to bridge modalities for more natural and effective interaction.
